# DEMO — the judge journey

Exact steps, exact expected output. Everything before "Paid" costs nothing.

## 0. Fresh clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshyadav442277/dossier && cd dossier && npm ci
```

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm test
```

Expected: `tsc` prints nothing; vitest ends with `Test Files  6 passed (6)` and `Tests  50 passed (50)`.

## 1. Preflight, free

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill `PAYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, set `DAILY_CALL_BUDGET=400`, a random `VISITOR_SALT`. Then:

```bash
npm run preflight
```

Expected (2026-09-06 shape; leaders move with each 9-hour epoch):

```
== environment

payer            0x…
daily budget     400 calls, per visitor 64, price cap $0.02, router timeout 65000 ms

== the questions, and who leads each intent today (the router chooses; this is who it is likely to choose)

```

## 2. Paid: one dossier from the command line (about $0.08)

```bash
npm run live -- research "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 in Hindi"
```

Expected shape, one line per question (miners, confidences and hashes will differ):

```

8/8 steps answered · 8 calls · $0.08 · intents: CONTENT_EXTRACTION, AI_TEXT_DETECTION, …
```

A step may show `ERROR` with the reason and whether anything was charged, or list a first ask
that was *unusable* or *off-target* followed by the second phrasing. The exit code is 0 when at
least half the steps answered.

```bash
npm run live -- news "AI regulation in India, in Hindi"
```

Expected: four questions; `headlines` and `search` routed to news miners, `brief` to a
CHAT_COMPLETION miner, `translate` to a LANGUAGE_TRANSLATION miner.

## 3. The site

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. Open <http://localhost:3000>. Heading: **Ask once. Get the case file.** Two tabs: Research
   paper, News topic.
2. Click the first example, *Extract the research paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 in
   Hindi*, then **Build the dossier**.
3. Eight step cards appear, numbered 01–08, each with its intent chip. They fill in one at a
   time: a spinner, then a stamp (`read`, `human_written`, `RECHECK`, `SUPPORTED`, `found`,
   `translated` …), a receipt block (miner and rank, routed as, confidence bar, cost and
   latency, signal link, settlement link, the router's reasoning) and the answer. A step that
   needed its second phrasing lists both asks under the receipt.
4. The paper card fills with title, authors, year, abstract, and the abstract in Hindi. The
   verdict grid shows Authorship, Fraud record, Key claim, Provenance.
5. The case summary lists one line per step and the totals: `8 Telegraph calls · 8 steps
   answered · $0.08 USDC paid · 7 intents · N miners`. A share box shows `/d/{id}`.
6. Open the share link in a private window: the same dossier, server-rendered, with "A saved
   dossier. Build your own →".
7. Click a signal link: `/verify/{hash}` shows the node's record, the payer wallet with the
   stamp **this app**, "In this app's ledger: yes", and the raw record.
8. Open `/ledger`: the seven stat tiles, the on-chain paragraph ("Payer wallet 0x… has made N
   USDC transfers to the Telegraph collector … Of the N settlement hashes on this ledger page,
   N appear among them"), the intents served, recent dossiers, and the calls table with the
   step's intent and what the router routed it as.
9. Switch to **News topic**, click *What's the latest on AI regulation in India, in Hindi*,
   **Brief me**. Four steps; the briefing card fills last, then its Hindi translation.

10. Switch to **Is this safe?**, click the first example (a fake bank "KYC" message with a link),
    **Check it**. Up to five checks; the verdict card turns to **Caution** or **No red flags**
    once the labels are in, with each check's miner and routed intent under it.

```bash
npm run live -- safety "Your SBI account will be blocked today, verify at http://sbi-kyc-update.xyz now"
```

Expected: `scan`, `cert`, `where`, `scam`, `redflags` answered through the router, and a verdict
line such as `Caution: 2 of 5 checks raised a red flag (Link scan, Red flags in the message).`

## 3b. MCP

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http dossier https://dossier-wukong4.vercel.app/api/mcp
```

Then in Claude Code: *"Use dossier_safety on: Your account will be blocked today, verify at
https://example.com/verify"*. Expected: a text result with the verdict line, one line per check
with miner, routed intent, signal and settlement, and the share link. Without a client:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://dossier-wukong4.vercel.app/api/mcp -H "content-type: application/json" -H "accept: application/json, text/event-stream" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

Expected: five tools.

## 3c. Telegram

Create a bot with @BotFather, put its token in `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and a random string in
`TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (locally and on Vercel), redeploy, then:

```bash
npm run telegram:setup
```

Expected: `webhook https://dossier-wukong4.vercel.app/api/telegram · pending 0` and the bot's
username. In Telegram, send the bot `/safe` followed by a suspicious message: one message
appears with a checklist that fills in per question, then the summary with the share link.

## 4. Judge journey, automated

```bash
npm run e2e
```

Expected: `7 passed`, `1 skipped` (the paid test). Against the deployment, with the paid test:

```bash
BASE_URL=https://<deployment> E2E_PAID=1 npm run e2e
```

Expected: `8 passed`.

## 5. Ship

Push as the project's GitHub account (the repo's local identity is already set to it):

```bash
gh auth login
```

```bash
gh repo create Harshyadav442277/dossier --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

On Vercel (the project's own account, not any other): **Add New → Project → Import**
`Harshyadav442277/dossier`; framework Next.js is detected; add the variables from `.env.example`;
**Storage → Upstash Redis → Connect**; deploy; then set `PUBLIC_URL` to the deployment URL and
redeploy. Verify with `curl https://<deployment>/api/health` (`payerConfigured: true`,
`paidWorkEnabled: true`, `store: "redis"`).

## 6. Submission text

*Dossier turns one question into a case file from the Telegraph network. Paste a paper or name a
news topic; it plans up to eight questions across seven canonical intents (extraction, AI-text
detection, fraud, fact-check, provenance, academic search, translation, or headlines, news
search, chat completion, translation), puts every one to Telegraph's own router, and returns one
document where every line carries the miner, its rank, the router's reasoning, its confidence,
the cost, the signal hash and the on-chain settlement. Every call is on a public ledger and
counted again from the payer wallet's USDC transfers on Base Sepolia.*
