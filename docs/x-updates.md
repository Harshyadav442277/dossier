# X updates

Rule 03: every update used for judging must be public on X and tagged @Telegraphprotoc. Fill the
brackets from `/ledger` at posting time; never round a number up. One live dossier link per post.

## 1 — Launch (post right after the first paid dossier on the deployment)

> One question, ten intents, one receipt trail.
>
> Dossier takes "read this paper in Hindi" and puts eight questions to the @Telegraphprotoc
> router: extraction, AI-text detection, fraud record, fact-check, provenance, related work,
> translation. The router picks every miner. Every line has the miner, its rank, the router's
> reasoning, its confidence, the cost and the on-chain settlement.
>
> Try it: [deployment URL]
> A real dossier: [/d/… link]

## 2 — Numbers (next morning, from /ledger)

> [N] Telegraph calls, [N] dossiers, [N] visitors in the first [N] hours of Dossier, paid from
> one wallet on Base Sepolia. The ledger counts them; Blockscout counts them again:
> [ledger URL]
>
> Most-called intents so far: [top three from the ledger chips]. Most-used miners: [slugs].
>
> News mode does the same for a topic: headlines → search → briefing → translation.
> [/d/… link] @Telegraphprotoc

## 3 — What the router did (before the deadline)

> Every Dossier question goes through @Telegraphprotoc's own router, and every receipt shows
> what it decided and why. Over [N] provenance questions the router chose [INTENT] [N] times
> and [INTENT] [N] times; [N] needed a second phrasing. Nothing was hand-picked.
>
> [/d/… link with a second-phrasing step]
> Ledger: [ledger URL] · Source: github.com/Harshyadav442277/dossier

## 4 — Is this safe? (once a real scam message has been checked)

> New in Dossier: paste the message your uncle forwarded. Five @Telegraphprotoc questions,
> five miners: link scan, certificate, where the host really is, fraud record, red flags in
> the text. Verdict from the miners' own labels, receipts on every line.
>
> [/d/… link of a Caution verdict] · [deployment URL]

## 5 — MCP and Telegram

> Dossier is now an MCP server and a Telegram bot. Any agent can call dossier_research,
> dossier_news or dossier_safety and get the case file with every @Telegraphprotoc receipt;
> in Telegram, paste the message your uncle forwarded and watch the checks come in one by one.
>
> `claude mcp add --transport http dossier https://dossier-wukong4.vercel.app/api/mcp`
> Bot: @[handle]

## Replies worth having ready

- "Is the money real?" — Testnet USDC on Base Sepolia. The answers and the miners are real; the
  settlement transactions are on BaseScan.
- "Why not one call?" — Because a paper is not one question. Each intent has its own ranked
  specialist; Dossier composes them and keeps every receipt.
- "How do I check a receipt?" — Open the signal link; it shows the node's record and whether our
  wallet paid for it. Or paste the hash into the node's `/engine/v1/signal/{hash}` yourself.
