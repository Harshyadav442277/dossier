# PRD — Dossier

Telegraph Hackathon Season I, Track 3 (Applications). Track window Aug 31 – Sep 7 2026; the
submission form closes **2026-09-07 23:59:59 UTC**. Written 2026-09-06.

## Claim

**Anyone with a link or a topic can now get a verified, multi-intent case file from the
Telegraph network in one question**, because we solved the composition problem: one sentence
is planned into a fixed sequence of questions, each question is handed to Telegraph's own
router (which classifies the intent and picks a ranked miner), and the receipts are stitched
into one dossier that can be checked step by step on the node and on the chain.

## Reality checks

### Jargon strip

Telegraph is a market where small programs called miners answer questions for about a cent
each, and get ranked by how good their answers are. It has a router: you ask in plain words and
the router decides what kind of question it is and which miner should answer. Most apps built
on it ask one question and show one answer. Dossier takes one request, such as "read this paper
in Hindi", and turns it into eight questions for the router: what is on the page, what is the
abstract, was the abstract written by a machine, has the paper been retracted or faked, is its
main claim true, does it exist in the library under that name, what else has been written on the
subject, and how does it read in Hindi. Each answer comes back with a receipt: who answered, why
the router chose them, how sure they were, what it cost, and the blockchain record of the
payment. News works the same way with today's headlines, the week's articles and a written
briefing.

### Status quo

A person vetting a paper today opens five tabs: the paper, Google Scholar, Retraction Watch, an
AI-text detector, a translator. It takes ten minutes and leaves no record. On Telegraph, the
organisers' reference apps and the first-week Track 3 entries ask one intent per question. The
judging rubric names "multi-intent & cross-domain" and "signal quality & verification" as
high-value areas precisely because nothing composes the network yet. That is what is bad about
the status quo: the intelligence exists, in pieces, and nobody assembles it with a paper trail.

### Who cares

- Students, journalists and reviewers who need to vet a source in a minute, with something to
  show for it.
- Agents that need a verified summary of a document or a topic with provenance attached.
- Telegraph's miners and organisers, who need real routed traffic: a research dossier sends
  eight questions through the router to up to seven intents, a news dossier three to four.

### Failure list, ranked by how likely it is to go wrong

1. **Not enough real users before the deadline.** This is what is being underestimated: 45% of
   the score is users and call volume, and there is one day. Mitigation: deploy today, share the
   link on X with real dossier links, ask in the hackathon Discord, put the ledger and the chain
   count where judges see them, make every dossier shareable.
2. **The paid path is unverified until the wallet key exists.** The 402 challenge is diffed
   against the client constants for free; the x402 client is built the way the official
   Telegraph MCP client builds it, on the same pinned version. One `npm run live` proves it; do
   that before anything else (GAPS G1).
3. **The router files a question under the wrong intent, or hands a link to a miner that
   cannot fetch.** Mitigation: every step carries a list of intents it can accept and two to
   four wordings; an answer that cannot be used is marked *unusable* and the next wording is sent;
   an answer under an unaccepted intent is marked *off-target* and, for steps where a wrong
   intent would mislead (extraction, detection, fact-check, translation), never used. All of it
   is on the receipt.
4. **Miners fail or go cold.** The FACT_CHECK leader has thrown 500s in bursts; two miners sit
   on free hosting that sleeps. The router keeps its own fallback miner; the app adds a
   48-second timeout and honest per-step errors that never hide a failure inside a summary.
5. **Serverless limits.** One question per HTTP request keeps every call inside one 60-second
   function.
6. **Payments collide when two people run at once** (the facilitator rejects a second
   in-flight payment from one wallet). Mitigation: questions run one at a time per user; a
   refused payment settles nothing and the next wording is a fresh attempt.
7. **The wallet is drained or abused.** Mitigation: daily budget, per-browser allowance, a
   per-payment cap of $0.02 inside the x402 client (the router may pick a miner charging $0.20;
   the client then refuses for free), pause flag, and paid work off by default.
8. **Traffic looks manufactured** (rule 04 is disqualification). Mitigation: no cron, no
   self-loops, no unattended jobs; a public ledger with hashed visitor ids; the on-chain count
   next to it.
9. **The submission form for Track 3 is unknown** until it opens. Mitigation: repo, live URL,
   payer address, X handle and a one-paragraph description ready in DEMO.md.
10. **Provenance has no real intent to land on.** CONTENT_VERIFICATION has one active miner and
    it verifies images. The question is put to the router as written and accepted under any of
    six related intents; the dossier says which one answered.

## Judging criteria

Weights are verbatim from the hackathon rules page (Track 3 tab), read 2026-09-06.

| Weight | Criterion | Where the hours go |
|---:|---|---|
| 45% | Real usage & adoption: number of real users + actual volume of Telegraph calls | Ship first, then share. Eight routed calls per research dossier, every one receipted and counted on `/ledger` and on the chain. Shareable dossier links for X and Discord. |
| 25% | Usefulness, creativity & depth of integration, off-chain and on-chain | The pipeline itself: ten intents, every question through the network's router with its reasoning shown, structured hints via `context`, confidence read from each miner's declared mapping, signal hashes and settlements on every line. |
| 25% | Engagement & updates on X, tagging @Telegraphprotoc | Three drafted updates in docs/x-updates.md, each with a live dossier link and the ledger's real numbers. |
| 5% | Technical execution & integration quality | Typecheck, 50 unit tests, the judge journey in Playwright, a free preflight that diffs the node's challenge, honest errors. |

Rules that shape the build: applications must use real miners, simulated or mocked data is not
allowed; metric inflation is disqualification; updates must be public on X and tagged.

## Novelty

- **What has not been done before:** one query planned into up to eight routed questions across
  seven canonical intents, assembled into one document with a per-question receipt that shows
  the router's decision and reasoning, and a ledger reconciled against the chain.
- **How this differs from the nearest existing thing:** the reference apps and the single-intent
  front doors give one answer per question; Dossier composes questions and verifies each leg.
  Aggregators blend answers; Dossier never blends, it stacks receipts.
- **The one unforgettable thing:** *One question, ten intents, one receipt trail you can check on
  the node and on the chain.*

## Scope

In: the two modes above plus **Is this safe?** (added 2026-09-06 12:00 UTC on the operator's
go: a link, wallet or message checked through URL_SCAN, SSL_VERIFICATION, IP_GEOLOCATION,
FRAUD_DETECTION and TEXT_CLASSIFICATION, verdict from the miners' labels), the ledger, share
links, the verify page, spending guards, the free preflight, the paid live script, the judge
journey. Out: accounts, wallets for users, agents'
API keys, Telegram or MCP surfaces, naming miners, re-ranking miners, automatic second
opinions, anything that sits between the user and the protocol's own judgement.
