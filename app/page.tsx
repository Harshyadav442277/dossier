        A paper someone sent you. A message that looks like a scam. A topic you need to brief on in a minute. Dossier turns the one question you have into a sequence of questions for Telegraph&apos;s router, which picks the intent and the miner for each, and hands you a case file where every line carries the miner that said it, how sure it was, what it cost, and the on-chain receipt.

            <p>
              Telegraph is a marketplace of miners, each an API answering one or more canonical intents, ranked every epoch by validators. Dossier never names a miner: every question goes to Telegraph&apos;s own router, which classifies the intent, picks a ranked miner and lines up a fallback, and the receipt shows what it decided and why. The app pays the x402 fee in testnet USDC from one wallet and keeps the receipt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nothing here is mocked. A step that fails says so and whether anything was charged. A miner that answers but cannot be used, such as a translation engine that lacks the language pair, is shown as answered-but-unusable, and the question is asked once more in different words. A question the router files under an intent the step cannot use is shown as off-target rather than passed off as an answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <a href="/ledger">ledger</a> lists every call this app has ever made, and counts the same calls again from the payer wallet&apos;s USDC transfers on Base Sepolia, read from a public explorer. Every signal hash opens on the node.
