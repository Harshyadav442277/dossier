# GAPS — what is missing, broken or unverified

Read before trusting a claim. Newest first within each state.

## Open

### G21 · Roughly a third of questions still fail on the network's side
Over 120 production rows on 2026-09-06/07: 72 answered; the rest were the router naming a miner
the node then called unroutable (15), an endpoint the miner does not declare (5), 48-second
timeouts (4), the facilitator timing out or refusing a second concurrent payment (5), and the
LaTeX and `context` faults since fixed. The free ones are now retried up to four asks per step
and payments are serialised (ARCHITECTURE A4); timeouts cannot be. Every failed step names its
cause and says nothing was charged.

### G3 · The page is read by the app, not by the network
Verified with paid probes on 2026-09-06: every phrasing containing a link was routed to
livecert (#1 for CONTENT_EXTRACTION), whose `/extract` reads inline text and returned empty
fields; "search the web for arXiv 1706.03762" went to an academic search of the literal string.
Dossier therefore reads the page's metadata tags itself (ARCHITECTURE A2b), labelled as free.
Pages without `citation_*` or Open Graph abstracts (many publisher paywalls) give a title and
no abstract; the abstract-dependent steps then skip and say why.

### G4 · CONTENT_VERIFICATION has one miner and it verifies images
The provenance question is put to the router as written and accepted under
CONTENT_VERIFICATION, ACADEMIC_SEARCH, FACT_CHECK, RESEARCH_QUERY, RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS or
WEB_SEARCH. If the router routes to the image miner, that call fails for free and the second
phrasing ("search the academic literature for a paper titled …") is sent.

### G5 · Off-target answers are kept for the non-strict steps
A WEB_SEARCH miner answering the provenance question is accepted and its prose is searched for
the title; the *found* verdict then depends on that prose. The receipt shows the intent and the
miner, and the routing line says it was filed elsewhere.

### G6 · Free-text topics and the #1 headlines miner
livecert's `/headlines` honours Google News sections and a region, not free-text topics. Whether
the router's parameter filling maps "AI regulation" to a section is unknown; the second phrasing
names the section the parser detected. The briefing names its sources either way.

### G7 · Memory store resets on every cold start
Without Upstash credentials the ledger, counters and dossiers live in the function instance.
Fine for local use; on Vercel set the Redis integration before sharing links.

### G8 · Abuse controls are per browser, not per person
Clearing the cookie resets the allowance; the global daily budget is the real ceiling. No IP
limits. Acceptable for a testnet budget the operator can pause.

### G9 · Translation is the first 700 characters
Cut at a sentence boundary. The translation miners' limits are undocumented.

### G10 · One slow question fills the function
Router timeout 48 s inside a 60 s function. A timed-out question is not re-asked (it may still
settle late; the chain count would show it and the ledger would not) and the step fails with a
timeout message.

### G11 · Track 3 submission form not yet seen
Its field list is unknown. Repo, live URL, payer address, one-paragraph description and the X
handle are ready in DEMO.md.

### G12 · No X posts yet, no users yet
The 45% criterion is untouched until the deployment is public and shared.

### G13 · Visitors are browsers
A random cookie hashed with a salt. One person on two devices is two visitors; ten people reading
one shared dossier are zero. Published next to the number on `/ledger`.

### G14 · Router accuracy on long questions is unmeasured
The AI-text and translation questions carry up to 4,000 characters of passage. Whether the
classifier still files them correctly, and whether it truncates what it copies into the miner's
`text`, can only be seen with paid traffic. `context` carries the exact passage as a hedge.

### G15 · The node's facilitator credits are exhausted, 2026-09-06 from ~09:18 UTC
Payments are refused with `insufficient_credits: facilitator returned 403`. PayAI's own docs:
one credit is one settled request, and when a merchant's balance hits zero `/settle` returns
`insufficient_credits`. The merchant is the Telegraph node (payTo is its collector), so this is
the network's account, not the payer's: our wallet holds 54 USDC and settled about 50 calls
until 07:30:42 UTC; the collector received three payments at 11:30 and nothing else since 09:17
(Blockscout, read 11:45). Nothing in the app can fix it; every step shows the node's message and
that nothing was charged. Worth reporting in the hackathon Discord; re-run `npm run ask -- "test"` to see when
it clears.

### G17 · The message check is answered by fraud miners, not classifiers
The TEXT_CLASSIFICATION wording timed out through the router twice (48 s, no miner named). The
plain-words wording is filed under FRAUD_DETECTION and telegraph-sentinel answers in under a
second with a clear verdict, so that phrasing goes first and FRAUD_DETECTION is accepted for
the step. The step is still labelled TEXT_CLASSIFICATION; the receipt shows what the router
chose. URL_SCAN went to the #10-ranked URLhaus miner on every ask (three runs); its empty answer
means "not listed" and is read as such.

### G18 · The safety verdict is a heuristic over prose
Sentence-level and negation-aware, with an explicit "% risk" figure winning. It has been checked
against the answers seen today (a burn address, a clean URL, a phishing message); a miner that
phrases danger inside a negation ("not safe") reads as clear. Every check's own words are shown
beside the verdict so a reader can overrule it.

### G19 · The network is flaky on 2026-09-07 and the app can only show it
Seen on one research run at ~06:00 UTC: the router named miners the node then declared "not
currently routable" (scholarwire for ACADEMIC_SEARCH, textprocessing-sentiment for
SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS), the facilitator's `/settle` timed out ("context deadline exceeded"), and
the AI_TEXT_DETECTION miners were unavailable so the router fell back to a chat model, which the
strict authorship step refuses. All are free failures and are named on the step. A third ask
with the first wording is now allowed when both phrasings died as unroutable.

### G20 · Telegram is untested until a bot token exists
The webhook route, the command parser, the progress editing and the setup script are written
and unit-tested, but no bot has been created, so no message has gone through. `waitUntil` keeps
the run alive after the 200; on Vercel the function's 300 s ceiling applies to the whole
dossier. The MCP endpoint has been exercised end to end (initialize, tools/list, a paid
`dossier_safety` call) locally.

## Closed

### G2 · `context` hints — CLOSED 2026-09-07 15:40 UTC, removed everywhere
Confirmed twice: a Bedrock chat miner the router picked rejected the extra key ("extraneous key
[text] is not permitted"), for the key-facts question on 2026-09-06 and for translation and
detection on 2026-09-07 (translation answered 2 of 8). No step sends `context` any more; the
sentence carries the passage, the target language and the instructions.

### G1b · Deployment configured — CLOSED 2026-09-06 11:40 UTC
Payer key set, Upstash Redis connected (`store: "redis"`), budget 400, caps, salt and public URL
set; the free judge journey passes on production and 28 rows persisted across instances.

### G16 · Memory store split across instances — CLOSED by G1b

### G1 · The paid path — CLOSED 2026-09-06 ~09:40 UTC, paying locally
Payer `0xFEc66E0F5c64296fF190EdCeD88C781eeEdFd9d3`. First routed calls settled at $0.01 each (for
example signal `0x216578cd…` → tx `0xd38f1c13…`, signal `0xf048a710…` → tx `0x3fd5e3d4…`). The
news dossier answered 4/4 through the router (livecert, verity-news-search, newswire-search,
test-mymemory-translate). Two research dossiers through the UI passed the paid journey test
(at least five steps with signal hashes each). Two early `unpaid` refusals were transient and
did not recur.

### G0 · Direct-dispatch request shapes — SUPERSEDED 2026-09-06 06:20 UTC
Eleven direct payloads had been validated against the node's free pre-check. The operator then
ruled out direct dispatch altogether; every question now goes through the router and those
shapes are no longer sent. The readers built from the same probes remain.
